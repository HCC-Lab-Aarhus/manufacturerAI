"""Placer — positions all components inside the device outline.

Submodules:
  models        Output dataclasses and configuration constants.
  geometry      Low-level geometry helpers (containment, clearance, AABB gaps).
  nets          Net connectivity graph for scoring.
  scoring       Candidate position scoring (net proximity, clearance, compactness).
  engine        Main placement algorithm (grid-search with hard/soft constraints).
  serialization JSON conversion (placement_to_dict, parse_placement).
