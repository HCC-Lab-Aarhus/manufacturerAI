These values describe the physical properties of conductive-ink traces,
pin holes, and board edges.  Both the **placer** (which reserves routing
channels between components) and the **router** (which lays down actual
traces) derive their clearance parameters from this single source of truth.

Change a value here and both stages will stay in sync automatically.
