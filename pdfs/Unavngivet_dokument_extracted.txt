Generative  Parametric  Design:  Bridging  Large  Language  Models  (LLMs)  and  3D  
Manufacturing
 Supervisor:  Michael  Wessely 
The  Challenge:  Traditional  product  design  is  slow.  A  brainstormed  idea  must  be  manually  modeled  
in
 
CAD,
 
checked
 
for
 
printability,
 
and
 
iterated
 
upon—a
 
process
 
that
 
can
 
take
 
hours
 
or
 
days.
 
We
 
are
 
skipping
 
the
 
manual
 
design
 
phase
 
entirely.
 
The  Vision:  We  want  to  create  the  foundation  for  a  "Star  
Trek
 
Replicator"
 
that
 
instantly
 
translates
 
human
 
intention
 
into
 
a
 
physically
 
realizable
 
3D
 
object.
 
You
 
will
 
design
 
a
 
system
 
where
 
a
 
user
 
simply
 
describes
 
the
 
product
 
they
 
need,
 
and
 
the
 
system
 
automatically
 
generates
 
a
 
guaranteed
 
3D-printable
 
CAD
 
file
 
moments
 
later.
 
The  Goal:  To  successfully  link  a  state-of-the-art  Large  
Language
 
Model
 
(LLM)
 
to
 
a
 
code-based
 
parametric
 
CAD
 
engine
.
 
This
 
project
 
is
 
about
 
proving
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
accelerate
 
the
 
product
 
development
 
lifecycle
 
from
 
days
 
to
 
minutes,
 
turning
 
natural
 
language
 
into
 
executable
 
manufacturing
 
instructions.
 
Task  1:  Intent  Capture  and  Parameter  Extraction  (The  LLM  Interface)  
This  module  handles  the  natural  language  input.  
●  Integrating  with  a  powerful  LLM  (via  API)  to  receive  a  user's  prompt  (e.g.,  "Design  a  remote  
control
 
with
 
8
 
buttons
 
and
 
a
 
wrist
 
strap
 
hole").
 ●  Developing  an  LLM  prompt  engineering  strategy  to  force  the  model  to  output  structured,  
machine-readable
 
parameters
 
(e.g.,
 
JSON
 
format
 
specifying
 
product_type:
 
remote_control,
 
button_count:
 
8,
 
feature_strap_hole:
 
true).
 
Task  2:  Parametric  Model  Logic  
●  Developing  the  Python-based  logic  for  a  chosen  product  family  (e.g.,  Custom  Enclosures  or  
Ergonomic
 
Handles
).
 ●  Implementing  a  parametric  CAD  script  using  a  library  like  OpenSCAD  or  CadQuery.  This  
script
 
uses
 
the
 
LLM's
 
parameters
 
as
 
inputs
 
to
 
mathematically
 
define
 
the
 
geometry.
 
Task  3:  System  Integration  and  Output  
This  module  connects  the  AI  brain  to  the  manufacturing  tool.  
●  Developing  a  simple  Python  application  to  manage  the  API  calls,  the  parameter  passing,  and  
the
 
execution
 
of
 
the
 
parametric
 
script.
 ●  Generating  the  final,  clean  geometry  as  a  standard  STL  file  that  is  instantly  ready  for  a  3D  
printer
 
slicing
 
software.
